rxcw
====

In the mid 1990s, I wanted to accomplish two tasks:

- get an Italian Amateur Radio license with full band plan access
- learn C programming

In those days, in order to obtain the the full Amateur Radio licence, you had
to go through a rather draconian morse code exam which would test your rx/tx
skills.  I had plenty of software which allowed me to test my receiving skills,
but no software that I could use to plug a straight key into my pc and check
that I was transmitting correct morse code.

A friend of mine gave me a copy of the Microsoft C Compiler for the MS/DOS
Platform, the Kernighan and Ritchie book "The C Programming Language" and a few
notions about the functions I should have called to interact with the serial
port.

This software was born out of this context. It's been my first exercise in
learning how to write software, therefore the code is rather ugly. There are
documents in italian explaining how to hook up the straight key to the serial
port and how to operate the software. An executable is also provided; I've run
it in 2012 on a machine with Windows XP and it still works.

This github repository exists basically for historic reasons and as a backup
for myself. I don't expect you to do anything useful with this stuff. There are
probably many other modern programs that can better do what rxcw did back in
the dawn of the IBM/PC era.

For what is worth, this software is released under the Apache Licence, Version
2.0.  Also, if you get your pc fried or you get injured while operating two AA
batteries or your girlfriend dumps you while using this software, I won't be
held responsible. Okay? We're good then.
